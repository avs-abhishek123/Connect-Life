## **Brief about the project**
> 
> **ConnectLife** built for about **1 month ago**, without a
> clean code or using a modern technologies and with no OOP concept or specific design
> pattern that makes the code understandable and reusable by other developers, that's why you may face a lot of bugs or issues with a specific feature in the project! because of the messive code that it's written with.
> 
> I was thinking about rebuild a new one with a new name, to be **fast,
> secure, fully featured, and easy to develop and use**.. with the use of the modern technologies, frameworks, and concepts that make the project more reusable ...
>  **but**!! I don't really started building it yet, that because of the time and my work .. but as soon as I can I'll start building it and till that moment! I promise it will be great :)
